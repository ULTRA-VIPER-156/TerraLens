Our project — TerraWatch: The Breathing Earth — explores how climate change is reshaping our planet’s ecosystems.

Using NASA’s Terra MODIS data from 2000 to 2025, we created an interactive, rotating globe that visualizes vegetation change over time.

Users can zoom in, explore local trends, and see how green cover has shifted near their homes.

By revealing patterns of droughts, floods, and forest loss, TerraWatch helps communities understand climate impacts — and inspires action to restore and protect our planet’s forests.
